The program asks the user to choose either a place (providing row and column) or a price or
to exit from the program. When the user specifies a place, make sure that it is free and that the
coordinates are inside the table. When specifying a price, you can assign any seat thatâ€™s available at
that price (if any). Mark seats already sold with a price equal to 0.
